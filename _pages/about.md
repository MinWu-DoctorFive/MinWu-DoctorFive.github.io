# **Biography**

I am a postdoctoral fellow at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) supported by the PolyU Postdoc Matching Fund Scheme, and work with [Prof. Kai Pan](https://sites.google.com/view/kaipanuf/home?authuser=0). I Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Hunan University , Changsha, China, in 2023, under the supervision of [Prof. Jiazhu Xu](https://scholargps.com/scholars/77776794750243/jiazhu-xu). I obtained my BEng in electrical engineering and automation from Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China, in 2018.

My research interests focus on the uncertainty of the integrated energy system optimization and dispatch, emphasizing mathematical models and solution methods.

I have served as a reviewer for the IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, Applied Energy, Renewable Energy, International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems, and other IEEE conferences.
